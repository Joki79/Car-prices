      "      This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the\n",
      "      specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b)\n",
      "      its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use\n",
      "      as compared to other cars.  The second rating corresponds to the\n",
      "      degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates.\n",
      "      Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its\n",
      "      price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is\n",
      "      adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this\n",
      "      process \"symboling\".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is\n",
      "      risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured\n",
      "      vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a\n",
      "      particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,\n",
      "      sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car\n",
