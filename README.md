# Car-prices

This project uses the car dataset published by https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile

The goal in this project is to analyze and impute missign data in the cars datset and then to build a linear regression model for predicting car prices

This project will be completed through following steps:

1. loading the dataset and txt file to extract columns

2.removing irrelevant columns and imputing the missing ('?') data

3.changing the datatype where needed and checking for possible collinearity between numerical columns

4.performing encoding of categorical variables and scaling numerical features

5.training and testing linear model 

6.evaluation

7.further considerations

# 2. I found following columns to be irrelevant or less relevant for the car price: Irrelevant columns: engine location,wheel base,length, width,height,
curb weight,bore(the inner diameter of the cylinder),stroke(the distance within the cylinder the piston travels), compression-ratio(the ratio between the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber in an internal combustion engine at their maximum and minimum )
